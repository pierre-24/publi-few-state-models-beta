  abstract = {The nonlinear optical properties of charge-transfer organic materials are discussed in the framework of a simple valence-bond charge-transfer model. This model leads to analytic formulas for the absorption frequency, hyperpolarizabilities, and bond length alternation, all of which are described in terms of three parameters, V, t, and Q related to the band gap, bandwidth, and dipole moment of the charge-transfer state. These parameters are derivable from experiment or from theory. The valence-bond charge-transfer model provides a clear physical picture for the dependence of the hyperpolarizabilities on the structure of charge-transfer molecules and leads to good agreement with the trends predicted by the AM1 calculations.},

Here, we demonstrate that this transferability can fail even in molecular crystals with weak van der Waals intermolecular interactions, due to the substantial (but often ignored) impact of polarization effects, particularly on the site energies. We show that the neglect of electronic polarization leads to qualitatively incorrect values and trends for the transfer integrals computed with the energy splitting method, even in simple prototypes such as ethylene or pentacene dimers. The polarization effect in these systems is largely electrostatic in nature and can change dramatically upon transition from a dimer to an extended system. For example, the difference in site energy for a prototypical ``face-to-edge'' one-dimensional stack of pentacene molecules is calculated to be 30\% greater than that in the ``face-to-edge'' dimer, whereas the site energy difference in the pentacene crystal is vanishingly small. Importantly, when computed directly in the framework of localized monomer orbitals, the transfer integral values for dimer and extended systems are very similar.},

These methods are based on density functional theory (DFT). We consider two perturbative Green's function effective Hamiltonian methods (first, at the DFT level of theory, using localized molecular orbitals; second, applying a tight-binding DFT approach, using fragment orbitals) and two constrained DFT implementations with either plane-wave or local basis sets. To assess the performance of the methods for through-bond (TB)-dominated or through-space (TS)-dominated transfer, different sets of molecules are considered. For through-bond electron transfer (ET), several molecules that were originally synthesized by Paddon-Row and co-workers for the deduction of electronic coupling values from photoemission and electron transmission spectroscopies, are analyzed. The tested methodologies prove to be successful in reproducing experimental data, the exponential distance decay constant and the superbridge effects arising from interference among ET pathways. For through-space ET, dedicated {$\pi$}-stacked systems with heterocyclopentadiene molecules were created and analyzed on the basis of electronic coupling dependence on donor\textendash acceptor distance, structure of the bridge, and ET barrier height. The inexpensive fragment-orbital density functional tight binding (FODFTB) method gives similar results to constrained density functional theory (CDFT) and both reproduce the expected exponential decay of the coupling with donor\textendash acceptor distances and the number of bridging units. These four approaches appear to give reliable results for both TB and TS ET and present a good alternative to expensive ab initio methodologies for large systems involving long-range charge transfers.},

The combined use of these two methods allows a direct identification and a quantification of both ``direct'' (coulomb and exchange) and through-bond (superexchange and charge-transfer) contributions. In addition, solvent effects are introduced using the polarizable continuum model. The method is applied to a family of naphthalene-bridge-naphthalene and naphthalene-bridge-anthracene systems, and the results obtained are compared with experiments. The results found suggest that the through-bond charge-transfer effects are not significant when the EET goes through permitted excitations on distant chromophores (see DN4 and DN6) while they become as important as (or even more important than) the covalent terms for EETs involving weakly allowed excitations (see A6N). By contrast, the presence of a very short bridge (in DN2) allows a very efficient delocalization of the excitation energy which is also largely modified by the presence of a solvent.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear optical imaging has revolutionized microscopy for the life sciences. Second harmonic generation (SHG), the younger sibling of two-photon excited fluorescence (2PF), is a technique that can produce high resolution images from deep inside biological tissues. Second harmonic light is generated by the coherent scattering of an ensemble of aligned chromophores in a focused, pulsed laser beam. SHG is only generated at the focal spot, reducing the background signal, and requires ordered chromophores, so is highly structure-specific. In contrast to two-photon fluorescence, the physical process that creates the signal does not require the formation of excited states, allowing elimination of harmful photochemistry. While the SHG of native proteins and biopolymers is well known, the use of exogenous dyes can provide SHG contrast from areas without a sufficiently high intrinsic quadratic hyperpolarizability, {$\beta$}. Dyes for SHG primarily target lipid bilayers; a trait that, combined with sensitivity to transmembrane potential, allows monitoring of action potentials in a variety of excitable cells, most importantly mammalian neurons. This article summarizes the principles of SHG imaging and explores approaches for maximizing the SHG signal from a biological specimen. We survey methods of optimizing the optical set-up, enhancing the {$\beta$} of the dye and achieving biological compatibility. In conclusion, we examine novel applications of SHG imaging and highlight promising directions for the development of the field.},

	abstract = {Molecular switches are chemical compounds exhibiting the possibility of reversible transformations between their different forms accompanied by a modification in their properties. Among these, switching of multi-addressable BenzazoloOXazolidines (BOXs) from a closed form to an open form results in drastic modifications in their linear and nonlinear optical properties. Here, we target molecules containing two identical BOX units (DiBOX) connected by different {$\pi$}-conjugated linkers, and we combine synthesis, UV/visible absorption, and hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) measurements, together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Three derivatives have been considered, which differ by the linker: (i) a bithiophene moiety (Bt), (ii) two 3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene (EDOT) units, and (iii) a triad composed of an EDOT-thiophene-EDOT sequence (TtO). As a matter of fact, these systems can adopt three states (CF-CF, POF-POF, and CF-POF) depending on the closed form (CF) or the protonated open form (POF) of each BOX unit. Despite chemical equivalence, stepwise switching of such systems under the addition of a chemical acid or an oxidant has been experimentally evidenced for two of them (DiBOX-Bt and DiBOX-TtO). Then, DFT calculations show that the first BOX opening leads to the formation of a push-pull {$\pi$}-conjugated segment, exhibiting a huge increase in the first hyperpolarizability ({$\beta$}) and a bathochromic shift with respect to the fully closed form. On the contrary, the second BOX opening induces not only a slight bathochromic shift but also a reduction in their {$\beta$} values conferring the great and uncommon abilities to modulate their linear and nonlinear properties over three discrete levels. Among these results, those on DiBOX-Bt agree with the experimental data obtained by HRS measurements and further shed light on their structure-property relationship.},

	abstract = {A general framework for the description of the physical properties of condensed matter by irreducible tcnsors is presented. Irreducible tensors have been widely used in atomic and Mol. Phys. but, surprisingly, less so in solid-state physics. In elasticity studies the strain and stress tensors are commonly decomposed into scalar (spherical) and deviatoric parts and more recently irreducible tcnsors have been introduced into discussion of non-linear optics and optical activity, but the approach is powerful and applicable to the analysis of the physical properties of condensed matter in general. The article aims to demonstrate this and to identify the kinds of argument about the properties of solids that can be best formulated in this way. The decomposition of a cartesian tensor into irreducible parts is considered for polar and axial tensors of rank n and the decompositions are given explicitly up to n = 4. Transformations of irreducible cartesian tensors into their spherical forms, and vice versa, are examined and the norm or magnitude is defined for reducible and irreducible tensors and applications are presented. Tensor index permutations are discussed with respect to their bearing on the decomposition of a tensor into irreducible points.},

SHG is surface specific due to the intrinsic symmetry constraints on the nonlinear process, providing a distinct analytical advantage over linear spectroscopic methods, such as fluorescence and UV-Visible absorbance spectroscopies. SHG has the ability to detect low concentrations of analytes, such as proteins, peptides, and small molecules, due to its high sensitivity, and the second harmonic response can be enhanced through the use of target molecules that are resonant with the incident ({$\omega$}) and/or second harmonic (2{$\omega$}) frequencies. This review describes the theoretical background of SHG, and then it discusses its sensitivity, limit of detection, and the implementation of the method. It also encompasses the applications of surface SHG directed at the study of protein-surface, small-molecule\textendash surface, and nanoparticle-membrane interactions, as well as molecular chirality, imaging, and immunoassays.

In particular, organic second-order NLO materials are very promising for meeting the combined requirements of ultra-low energy and ultra-high bandwidth in electro-optic (EO) modulation, while organic third-order NLO materials have good potential for applications in ultra-speed all-optical signal processing (AOSP). This review highlights the recent significant progress made in organic second- and third-order NLO materials. For second-order NLO materials, the recent advances in the efficient and cost-effective synthesis of dipolar polyene chromophores and thin-film engineering for efficient electric field poling are summarized. The applications and prospects of these high-performance EO materials are also discussed. For third-order NLO materials, we discuss the molecular design strategies of cyanine dyes for AOSP applications, particularly focusing on anionic tricyanofuran (TCF)-based cyanines. We aim to provide a better understanding of the structure--property relationships for cyanine-based AOSP materials.

	abstract = {Research into the area of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials and their applications has yielded a plethora of technological advancements in the last few decades. More specifically, the study and development of bespoke organic chromophores that are capable of second harmonic generation (SHG) have contributed significantly toward improvements in prospective materials that exhibit faster process speeds in data transfer, telecommunications, and optical switching, as well as other optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing demand for new improved materials, coupled with the rise of nanotechnology, requires the flexibility to scale down the physical size of such materials while retaining or improving their NLO responses as they are incorporated into nanodevices via nanofabrication techniques. A review of the recent scientific literature reveals how far research on organic NLO materials for SHG applications has advanced over the last few decades. This chapter presents a brief introduction to the phenomenon of NLO, SHG, and the considerations required when designing chromophores on a molecular level for such applications, before discussing the state of the art in the field and its future prospects.},

Representative derivatives of the three generations of DASAs, which differ by the nature of their electron-donating and withdrawing moieties and also include clickable species, have been synthesized and their photoswitching behavior fully characterized. The HRS measurements allow us to establish relationships between the magnitude of the SHG response of open forms and the nature of the donor and acceptor groups. The largest SHG responses are obtained for derivatives incorporating either a barbituric acid or an indanedione acceptor unit, while N-methylaniline appears as the most efficient donor group. The calculations support well the experimental data and show that high hyperpolarizabilities are associated to low excitation energies and large extent of the photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer, which enhances the dipole moment variation between the ground and first dipole-allowed electronic excited state. In addition, a complete investigation of the photoswitching kinetics of DASAs in chloroform solution shows important differences, highlighting in particular the role of the donor group on the photoswitching efficiency.},

Electronic absorption spectra and TD-DFT calculations reveal significant red-shifts in ligand-to-polyoxometalate charge transfer (LPCT) absorption bands for the 2D species compared to linear, dipolar analogues, consistent with the involvement of a larger conjugated (bridge + POM) system in the transitions. Electrochemical measurements indicate reversible, one-electron processes for the POM acceptors with class II mixed valence behavior observed where the POMs are connected to the same aryl ring and electronic isolation of the acceptors when they are on separate rings. Molecular first hyperpolarizabilities {$\beta$} have been determined using hyper-Rayleigh scattering at 1064 and 1200 nm: for the most active compound, the HRS measurements and depolarization studies reveal a strongly 2D, off-diagonal response ({$\beta$}0,zzz = 190 {\texttimes} 10--30 esu; {$\beta$}0,zyy = -56.5 {\texttimes} 10--30 esu), consistent with the wide A--D--A angle and TD-DFT computed electronic transitions, which show both phenyl bridges and POMs equally involved in the acceptor orbitals.},

The variation of mean second hyperpolarizability in these molecular systems has been explained in terms of the ground state dipole moment, mean linear polarizability and second-order polarizability. A number of relationships among these quantities have been derived in the framework of the sum-over-state scheme and the generalized Thomas--Kuhn sum rule. The spiroconjugation results in the significant increase of the mean polarizability. The appreciable enhancement of first hyperpolarizability due to the spiroconjugation between two dipolar monomer units has been accounted for the rather significant increase of the mean polarizability tensor and the ground state dipole moment. The relatively larger value of the average second hyperpolarizability of the spiroconjugated molecules compared to that of the corresponding monomers arises from the rather significant increase of the nonaxial component {$\gamma$}xxyy. The replacement of spirocarbon by spirosilicon results in the enhancement of the cubic polarizability manifold. The donor--acceptor substituted spirocompounds are predicted to be the superior third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) phores. The nature of {$\pi$}-conjugation in the monomer units around the spirocenter shows a strong modulation of the NLO properties of spirocompounds. The influence of electron correlation on the NLO properties at the MP2 level has been found to be rather significant.},

The experimental observations are well supported by DFT calculations.

Under the fully closed forms, all of them display negligible first hyperpolarizability ({$\beta$}) values. When one BOX is opened, which is sketched as C{$\rightarrow$}O, a push--pull {$\pi$}-conjugated segment is formed, having the potential to enhance {$\beta$} and to set the depolarization ratio (DR) to its one-dimensional-like value (DR = 5). This is observed when only one BOX is open, either for the monoBOX species (C{$\rightarrow$}O) or for the diBOX (CC{$\rightarrow$}CO) and triBOX (CCC{$\rightarrow$}CCO) compounds, i.e., when the remaining BOXs stay closed. The next BOX openings have much different effects. For the diBOXs, the second opening (CO{$\rightarrow$}OO) is associated with a decrease of {$\beta$}, and this decrease is tuned by controlling the conformation of the {$\pi$}-linker, i.e., the centrosymmetry of the whole compound because {$\beta$} vanishes in centrosymmetric compounds. For the triBOXs, the second opening gives rise to a {$\Lambda$}-shape compound, with a negligible change of {$\beta$}, but a decrease of the DR whereas, along the third opening, {$\beta$} remains similar and the DR decreases to the typical value of octupolar systems (DR = 1.5).},

	abstract = {The properties of molecules depend on their chemical structure, and thus, structure--property relations help design molecules with desired properties. Few-state models are often used to interpret experimental observations of non-linear optical properties. Not only the magnitude but also the relative orientation of the transition dipole moment vectors is needed for few-state models of the non-linear optical properties. The effect of the relative orientation of the transition dipole moment vectors is called dipole alignment, and this effect has previously been studied for multiphoton absorption properties. However, so far, no such studies are reported for the first hyperpolarizability. Here, we present a generalized few-state model for the static and dynamic first hyperpolarizability {$\beta$}, accounting for the effect of dipole alignment. The formulas derived in this work are general in the sense that they can be used for any few-state model, i.e., a two-state model, a three-state model, or, in general, an n-state model. Based on the formulas, we formulate minimization and maximization criteria for the alignment of transition dipole moment vectors. We demonstrate the importance of dipole alignment by applying the formulas to the static first hyperpolarizability of ortho-, meta-, and para-nitroaniline. The formulas and the analysis provide new ways to understand the structure--property relationship for {$\beta$} and can hence be used to fine-tune the magnitude of {$\beta$} in a molecule.},

It is found that 2D Cu-MOF exhibits a large nonlinear optical coefficient n2=5.20{\texttimes}10-11m2/Wand{$\chi$}3=8.24{\texttimes}10-11e.s.u. By contrast, no nonlinear optical effect was observed from 2D Zn-MOF under the same condition. The main reason is the Cu center of Cu-MOF has variable valence electrons and a vacant 3d atom orbit, which can form a conjugated system with organic ligands through the d-{$\pi$} interaction and therefore strengthen the nonlinear optical effect by the delocalization of {$\pi$} electrons. However, the Zn ion of Zn-MOF with fixed valence electrons and fully occupied d orbit makes it hard to produce observable nonlinear optical effect. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of 2D Cu-MOF in all-optical spatial light modulation and optical switch based on the principle of SXPM. This work sheds light on the physics of 2D MOFs in all-optical light modulation, providing an insight for rational design of 2D MOFs with high nonlinear optical coefficients in future.},

	abstract = {In this paper, density functional theory method was employed to study the electronic absorption spectrum and electronic static second hyperpolarisability of X-shaped pyrazine derivatives with twodimensional charge-transfer structures. Computational results show that the push--pull electron abilities of the substituent groups and the length of the conjugated chains affect the electronic spectrum and static second hyperpolarisability of the pyrazine derivatives. As the push--pull electron abilities of the substituent groups or the length of the conjugated chains increases, the frontier molecular orbital energy gap decreases, resulting in increased second hyperpolarisability and redshift of the electronic absorption bands. The electronic absorption spectra of the pyrazine derivatives maintain good transparency in the blue light band. The electronic static second hyperpolarisability exhibits a linear relationship to the frontier molecular orbital energy gap. Particularly, increasing/decreasing the push--pull electron abilities of the substituent groups considerably affect the static second hyperpolarisability in long conjugated systems, which is important to the modulation of molecular organic nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. The studied pyrazine derivatives show large third-order NLO response and good transparency in the blue light band and are thus promising candidates as NLO materials for photonics applications.},

	abstract = {The second hyperpolarizabilities ({$\gamma$}) of the stilbene molecular switch in its trans and cis forms have been calculated using quantum chemistry methods to address their third-order nonlinear optical contrasts, to assess the reliability of lower-cost DFT methods, and to make comparisons with experiments. First, the reference CCSD(T) method shows that trans-stilbene presents a {$\gamma$}{\textbardbl} value twice larger than its cis isomer (its {$\gamma$}THS value is 2.7 times larger). Among more cost-effective methods, reliable results are obtained at MP2 as well as with DFT, provided the CAM-B3LYP or {$\omega$}B97X-D XCFs are employed. Supplementary DFT calculations have investigated the relationships between the accuracy of the exchange--correlation functionals, the fulfillment of Koopmans' theorem, and the delocalization error, and they demonstrated that satisfying Koopmans' theorem is not the condition for the best accuracy but that functionals with small delocalization errors are generally efficient. Using the selected CAM-B3LYP, large {$\gamma$} enhancements by about 70\% (trans-stilbene) and 50\% (cis-stilbene) have been evidenced when accounting for solvent effects using an implicit solvation model (IEFPCM), even for apolar solvents. Then, the frequency dispersion of the {$\gamma$} responses has been described using Bishop polynomial expansions, allowing comparisons with a broad set of experimental data. To a certain extent, no systematic agreement between the calculations and the measured values was found. On the one hand, the agreement is satisfactory for the {$\gamma$}(-{$\omega$};{$\omega$},-{$\omega$},{$\omega$}) quantities, provided that the dominant vibrational contribution is taken into account. On the other hand, the agreement is poor for the {$\gamma$}(-2{$\omega$};{$\omega$},{$\omega$},0) and {$\gamma$}(-3{$\omega$};{$\omega$},{$\omega$},{$\omega$}) quantities, while some inconsistencies between experimental values are also highlighted.},

	abstract = {The liquid/air interface asymmetry leads to specific molecular interactions, compared to those observed in the bulk, and its characterization has significant implications for describing and controlling chemical and physical processes inherent to catalysis and environmental sciences. The second harmonic generation (SHG) is an interfacial selective spectroscopy often used to characterize interfaces. In this study, a computational multiscale methodology that combines molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry calculations has been worked out to scrutinize the SHG responses of 1-alcohols/air interfaces, and to unravel the role of the aliphatic chain length by exploring alcohols ranging from ethanol to pentanol. First, their molecular responses ({$\beta$}, the first hyperpolarizability) and then their macroscopic responses ({$\chi$}2, the second-order NLO susceptibility) have been computed and analyzed by decomposing the global responses into the contributions of successive molecular layers, providing relationships between the structure of the interfacial molecules and their dipolar SHG responses. The results show (i) an enhancement of the {$\beta$}ZZZ component (the component perpendicular to the interface) attributed to collective responses arising from the structural alignment of the interfacial molecules. Furthermore, (ii) longer aliphatic chains tend to create a bilayer structure, which was clearly observed at the pentanol/air interface where the polar heads of the molecules in the first and second molecular layers point toward each other. Such structural organization leads to a partial centrosymmetry at the interface, which is detrimental to the dipolar SHG response. On the other hand, (iii) owing to their smaller number density, the {$\chi$}ZZZ2 response of longer alcohols is smaller than for the smaller ones. Furthermore, (iv) a correlation between {$\chi$}ZXX2 and the aliphatic chain length is observed for the third molecular layer.},

These numerical simulations provide a complete atomistic picture of the morphology of the SAMs, revealing a high degree of positional disorder and an almost isotropic orientation of the chromophores. Subsequent DFT calculations, carried out to evaluate the average first hyperpolarizability of indolino--oxazolidine switches within the SAM, predict that the structural disorder does not significantly reduce the NLO contrast compared to that of the isolated molecules. Chromophores in the SAM can assume a limited number of specific conformations, due to the high rotational barrier that characterize the conjugated bonds along the indolino/oxazolidine-dyene-thiophene sequence. A notable exception is the rotation about the thiophene--thioalkyl bond, which is not only almost free, but also strongly correlated with the magnitude of the first hyperpolarizability. Controlling this rotation by chemical design could thus be a viable strategy to optimize the SAMs NLO response and the performance of photoresponsive devices based on indolino/oxazolidine switches.},

In this work, we demonstrate how second-harmonic scattering (SHS) is sensitive to the balance between the nano-object shape symmetry and size, thereby allowing for a SHS-defined topological definition. Although many data on nano-objects have been reported with this method so far, in most cases dispersed in liquid suspensions, no topological retrieval has been proposed. To reach this task, we have measured the second-harmonic scattered light from a series of representative nano-objects along two collection directions for well-defined polarization states. The experimental results are then recast within a general framework involving nonlinear emitting sources and the size as critical elements. This analysis leads to the classification of the nano-objects according to the topology defined by their SHS response.},
