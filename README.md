# Influence of symmetry on the second-order NLO properties: insights from the few state approximations

## About the paper

A publication on the few state approximation to NLO tensors elements, by Dr. [P. Beaujean](https://pierrebeaujean.net) and Prof. B. Champagne.

*A series of valence bond charge-transfer (VB-$n$CT) models ($n \in [1,4]$) are enacted to assess the influence of molecular symmetry on the second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, the first hyperpolarizability, $\beta$. This is accomplished for different amplitudes of the ground-state charge-transfer character, quantified by the VB-CT mixing parameter, $m_{CT}$.  The analysis focuses on quantities accessible from the second harmonic scattering (SHS) phenomenon and measurements, $\beta_{SHS}$ and its depolarization ratio. Among the symmetries considered, $D_{3h}$ and $C_{3v}$ (VB-3CT, with large $\theta$, i.e. for almost planar tripod-shape molecules) yield the largest $\beta_{SHS}$ values provided $m_{CT}$ is large, followed by $T_d$ (VB-4CT). These cases correspond to dominant octupolar responses and depolarization ratios close to $\nicefrac{3}{2}$.  Other symmetries result in comparatively weaker responses, and a variety of depolarization ratios. Maximizing the charge-transfer dipole moment $\mu_{CT}$ and minimizing the ratio $\xi = T/t$, are also identified as critical factors for enhancing the second-order NLO responses.*
